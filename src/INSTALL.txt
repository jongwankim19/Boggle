This project is similar to A2/3 in a sense that it's a text based game.

To play the game, follow the following procedures:
1) Download and unzip
2) make build on terminal/command prompt
3) make play

We struggled a lot initally and honestly still are, so the progress we have 
right now is pretty small. Although we finished implementing the prefix tree,
we haven't been able to figure out how to read all words from dictionary.txt 
and load it to the prefix tree. Once we figure that out, we think that we can 
make more rapid progress. For now, running "make play" displays the game board 
with each randomly generated letters. Once the board is displayed, the user must 
exit out of interactive mode by clicking ^C. For testing, make sure that each 
tile is at most 2 lowercase letters and that there are exactly 16 tiles.
